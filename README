Setup
=====

1) install pandoc, a markdown converter that works with LaTeX

    $ sudo port install pandoc

At time of writing this fails to install, so go to
http://code.google.com/p/pandoc/downloads/list and download a working solution.

2) install ruby dependencies

    $ gem install jekyll pandoc-ruby
