          Kalman Filters and their extensions are basic tools for tracking
          robots. While the standard Kalman Filter is quite simple, the flurry
          of extensions offering better numerical stability and increased
          applicability can be quite daunting. This library takes care of that
          for you.

          I use Vim. A lot. This config contains all of my settings (350
          lines!) and addons I use every day.  Give it a try, you might be
          surprised how much better Vim can be!

          Code used for generating this blog.  It ends up getting Jekyll to
          play nice with $\LaTeX$ can be quite a pain -- fork this to get
          yourself up and running without the hassle!

          There are a lot of optimization algorithms out there, but finding one
          place where you can try them all out is tough. `yannopt` lets you
          define an optimization problem throw every tool in the box at it.
          Mirror Descent? Newton's Method? Accelerated Proximal Gradient?
          It's all here.
